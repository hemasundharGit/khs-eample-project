 its a culture adopting in your orgainization that would incerease or improves ability to delivery their applications

devops AS  a CI/CD continous integration continous delivery 
improving delivery by ensuring that the following steps 
automation
quality
monitoring
testing

----->devops is a process of improving the apppliction delivery by ensuring that there is proper autmation in place quality that maintained continious monitoring
and finnaly there is continious testing  in place "final goal is to fasten the application delivery"

why devops?
 
----> To improve the process of delivery to overcome the multiple teams like system admin,build and release engineer,server admin 
----> 

hypervisior  physical server logical server cloud 


letsus consider aws if i need to create a  vm that is using ec2 so for 1 time its okay if i need to create fo 100 times then we will using api 
which consists of script that make call or communcation with the aws dashboard without opening it   the script will be return by devops engineer
or sys admin to communicate with api we need to write a script that is aws cli or aws api(boto3) teraform or aws cft by doing this we had reached efficiency 
and achived devops startegy   ec-2 and teraform  based on iaas and aws has (AWS CDK)    
 
the oragnazation opting hybrid cloud we will use terraform 

commands inn shell scripting

df -h for disk space

free -g for memory

nproc 

set -x to represnt the commands used during the output that when we are executed in place of echo 
ps -ef says that what are the processes running on the current machine 
if i need the id of a certaion process trhenb i will use 
ps -ef | grep "amazon"
it returns all the amazon process running on the amazon 

./test.sh | grep 1

date | echo "date is"
pipe is used to link two commands but here date commands sends to std in so pipe doesnot pipe will not recive the output from std in


if a manager asks dont give me the entire information of the amazon but give me about single sort so we will use 

command is awk 

how to use awk command 
ps -ef | grep amazon |awk -F" " '{print $3}'


set -e it will be terminated when there is a error

at it will not work on the pipe command errors
if we need to rectify that error 
set v-o pipefail


curl retrives displays the information present in the log files 

example curll https://github.com/logpai/loghub/blob/master/Android/Android_2k.log | grep ERROR it will display the error present in the log file 

wget will download  after download we will get the log file but curl just displays the log file without downloading 



shell scripting project with github integartion 
There are Two ways to talk to applications 
1. Api
2. Cli

to access through th eapplication we use 
curl or
grpc           using http



git and github 
svn
cvs
git

wahstis the differnce between centralized and distriibuted version 
control system

to create a public or a private key in linux we use command :
              ssh-keygen -t rsa          

for creating a branch
git checkout -b "branch-name"

git branch

to leave from the main branch we use the following command 
git checkout main 


to merge the branches
git merge
git rebase
git cherry-pick


git cherry-pick : we are picking the commits 
git cherry-pick  "commit id" from the brach "git log division"
cherry-pick is used for one or two commits 

if a organization has 60000 commits we use "git merge" or "git rebase"

differnce between git  rebase and git merge is if we need to do in linear way we need to use git-rebase
we need to in non-linear way we use git-merge

hoisting my first nodejs application in aws ec2=elastic compute cloud its a kind of virtual cloud in which we use in organizations for increase the rate of workflow with minimum costs we will learn it in future 

Aws services  used in Devops 
EC2-elastic compute cloud
VPC-virtual private cloud for securing EC2 security rules,cidr,inbound and outbound rules
