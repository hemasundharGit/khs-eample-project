configuration management
let us take a system admin and an on permises server if i need to update all these 50 servers
upgrades
secure patents
installation

in old days we use scripts for handling this but it becomes complex so to overcome these  
they moved to cloud the problem becomed very bigger because they created 10x greather than before 
the concept is configuration management 
tools like
puppet
chef
ansible
salt 

but ansible became popular most people use ansible in devops journey 


puppet
pull mechanism model
master slave architecture
master is master branch and instances take it as slaves 
puppet language



ansible
push mechanism model
agent less model 
password less autentication
inventory file
dynamic inventory
windows,linux
simple(yaml)language 
we can write own ansible modules
ansible galaxy we can share the modules with others

ansible uses python
supports both windows "winrm"
linux "ssh"

Disadvantages:
windows has little problem with ansible
ansible not good with debugging
ansible performance is some what slow

managing ec2 instance using ansible 
push mechanism 
i will write a script i will push that script at a tome into two instances so at a time upadte will be possible through ansible in that i am using in windows

its easy to install ansible in linux because linux provides the correct environment better than windows or some x platforms 
to install ansible the command is sudo apt install ansible 

in ansible we are doing password less authentication so for that we are creating the key or a public key using "ssh-keygen" so it will create a key that is used in password less authentication 

ls /home/ubuntu/.ssh/
they u will get one private and one publi key we need to share only the public key while we access the other servers 
for that lets go ls /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_rsa.pub they u will get the public u need to share that with another srevre

the prerequesite of ansible is password less authentication
for that for that i created two server in one server i installed ansible and i created target server and what i am doimg is i am i logged into my target server using the ansible server by just few steps that is
first open the target server in other tab and then 
ssh-keygen it will create the authorized keys 
then vim~/.ssh.authorized-keys
in that paste the key that which is u copied from the ansible server that public key in target server then save it 

go to your ansible server copy the private ip address of the target server the 
ssh "ip-address" 
then miracle u will be able to see without any password u logged into the target server

ansible playbook its like in python we will call python file as like while writing anyscript in ansiblw we will call it as ansible playbook 

ansible adhoc commands

lets say inventory file i we have 100's of ip-address and we will store it in inventory file and then we will run 
ansible -i inventory all or if we have one ip-address name will go for ansible -i inventory "ip-address"

now create a inventory file in the main server and save the private ip address of the atrget server and use the command   ansible -i inventory all -m "shell" -a "touch devopsclass"  enetr this in the main server 
and magic u will see that the devopsclass file os created in the target server

 ansible-playbook -i inventory ansible_playbook.yml

- name: Install and start nginx
  hosts: all
  become: true
  tasks:
    - name: Install nginx
      apt:
        name: nginx
        state: present
    - name: Start nginx
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started


 ansible-playbook -vvv -i inventory ansible_playbook.yml
this command is used to see how does the main server using playbook yaml script to do the certain task in the target server
