pillars of aws
operational excellence -> development,run workloads,small changes ,anticipate failure
sercurity : iam.,racebility,layers
relability -> failure recovery , auto scaling (elasticity)
performance efficiency ->advanced technology 
cost optmization -> stop heavy spending 
sustainbility -> long term goals 

lets say if we see that any temporary we need to see the option ( token ) in the option 

sercurity :
dos,ddos attack : aws sheild 
WAF : web appliacation fire wall, sql injection attacks,bots,ip address blocking
multi factor authentication is provided by (iam) employees of company , mfa support is taekn by i am credential 

aws cognito users of website uses by mfa,social media login 

lets say we say number of sercurity at one place check there hub,or a group like dashboard or parking 

effectiently and improve process -> opretaional excellence think in the aspect of os (oprating systems)


lets say if the question comes in the concept of s3 there u see the options like "amazon macie" and analysis machine learning tool is also aamazon maice then that is the answer in one scenario 
in another senario there will be galcier , deep archive and soon  cost effective in s3 deep archive or intelligent tiering

lets say there comes any document  or reports related to security or government there the answer as "Aws Artifact"

lets say i anyone ask the report like external service u go through the "iam crendital report"

when comes the topic of gpu to handle heavy workloads we go for "Acclerated computing"

while coming to acl its stateless and it allows and starts seeing lowest number and goes to highest number then decide allow or not 

sercuriy group -> state full, service level,allow traffic,

Acl -> state less ,allow and deny traffic, preceding rule numbers,vpc level,

lets say if the question consits of platform oreinted caf then go for -> date engeering and ci/cd

while it comes to the aws caf there we need to see the answers related to sercurity 

legts say u need to migrate the toatal unstructure as a resources to inflight and data need to be encrypted on the move then go for "data sync" 

lets a company want to test and deploy "fast" then they go for Ans : "cloud formation"

lets say if the question consits of ci/cd  quickly implement ci/cd pipeline then go for   "aws code star"
in aws code star lets say we have in pipe line code commit,code build,code deploy and code pipe line these will pre definedly created by "code-star"

lets say in easy crud is "clous trail"

lets if the question consits of outpost the answer is "hybrid"

fully managed graph database then go for "aws neptune"

if the questions consists of desktop or laptop then go for "Aws-Workspace"

lets say ec2 we will have ebs and efs and ec2 is locally contains of ebs and when will efs when we need to store various files then we will go for efs 
then if when ec2 is terminated the the answer is "Aws ec2 instance store"

when there comes the topic of static in the permesies of hoisting we will go for "s3"

lets say when we need to generate the report in s3 we will go for "aws anthena"

Which AWS feature provides a no-cost platform for AWS users to join community groups, ask questions, find answers, and read community-
generated articles about best practices?  for these the sevice is "aws-repost"

lets say in s3 text in document in s3 go for "Aws-Kendra"

lets say "aws-lex" that is used in buliding the interfaces for text and message  
For example : go for hey google, or alexa chatbot it is used "Aws-Lex" is used in buliding like that chatbots 

when the topic comes about the edge locations go for "cloudfront" & "global-accletaor"


when coming the concept of fast deployment and less complexcity we will go for "Aws-Beanstalk"

lets say Aws Rote53 its like maps to travel or it say the route to the ip addresses or websites

Aws direct connect = is like private company connection with aws
