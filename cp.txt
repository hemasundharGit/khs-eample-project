pillars of aws
operational excellence -> development,run workloads,small changes ,anticipate failure
sercurity : iam.,racebility,layers
relability -> failure recovery , auto scaling (elasticity)
performance efficiency ->advanced technology 
cost optmization -> stop heavy spending 
sustainbility -> long term goals 

lets say if we see that any temporary we need to see the option ( token ) in the option 

sercurity :
dos,ddos attack : aws sheild 
WAF : web appliacation fire wall, sql injection attacks,bots,ip address blocking
multi factor authentication is provided by (iam) employees of company , mfa support is taekn by i am credential 

aws cognito users of website uses by mfa,social media login 

lets say we say number of sercurity at one place check there hub,or a group like dashboard or parking 

effectiently and improve process -> opretaional excellence think in the aspect of os (oprating systems)


lets say if the question comes in the concept of s3 there u see the options like "amazon macie" and analysis machine learning tool is also aamazon maice then that is the answer in one scenario 
in another senario there will be galcier , deep archive and soon  cost effective in s3 deep archive or intelligent tiering

lets say there comes any document  otr reports related to security or govennment there the answer as "Aws Artifact"

lets say i amyone ask the report lije external sefrvivce u go through the "iam crendital report"

when comes the topic of gpu to handle heavy workloads we go for "Acclerated computing"

while coming to acl its stateless and it allows and starts seeing lowest number and goes to highest number then decide allow or not 

sercuriy group -> state full, service level,allow traffic,

Acl -> state less ,allow and deny traffic, preceding rule numbers,vpc level,

lets say if the question consits of platform oreinted caf then go for -> date engeering and ci/cd

while it comes to the aws caf there we need to see the answers related to sercurity
